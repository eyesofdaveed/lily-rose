      <h2>Our Guarantee</h2>
      <p>
        Every order is important to us because we know how important it is to
        you. Hence, we earnestly endeavor to please every customer with
        beautiful flowers and accommodating service. Knowing that flowers are a
        perishable natural product and that floral arrangements and floral gifts
        are handmade, we make every effort to fortify our floral products and
        ensure the quality, accuracy and beauty of our work. Many variables
        determine whether a flower will last as long as anticipated or whether a
        designer has created something which you will enjoy. Because we
        constantly seek ways to bring some of these variables under our control
        for improved floral performance, we welcome your comments and inquiries.
        Also, if you are not completely satisfied with the quality of one of our
        products, then please contact us immediately and we will promptly take
        the appropriate action.

      <h2>Delivery Policy</h2>
      <h3>Ordering During Holidays</h3>
      <p>
        Our store and delivery hours may vary for major holidays. To help ensure
        on-time delivery during the busy holiday season, place your order at
        least two day prior to the following holidays:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Valentine's Day</li>
        <li>Easter</li>
        <li>Administrative Professionals Week</li>
        <li>Mother's Day</li>
        <li>Father's Day</li>
        <li>Good Friday</li>
        <li>Labor Day</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <b>Specific Times:</b> We are unable to guarantee delivery at a specific
        time, but we are normally able to deliver within four hours on orders.
        You may request a time frame in the special instruction box when
        ordering, and we will do our best to accommodate your request.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Delivery Times:</b> Normal delivery times are 9am-5pm daily for
        orders going to a business, 8pm for orders to a residence, hotel, or
        hospital, and 2pm for orders going to a high school. During major
        holidays such as Valentine's Day and Mother's Day we operate extended
        hours and delivery times are 8am-9pm.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Funeral Homes:</b> These orders are our very highest priority. If you
        have ordered too late to make the funeral service we will call to let
        you know quickly so that you can make other arrangements or have
        something sent to the home of the family. If you do not know the zip
        code or exact address of the funeral home we will look it up for you. We
        normally contact the funeral home anyway to verify the time of the
        viewing and make arrangements for the flower delivery. If you have
        selected a delivery date that is before the actual viewing we will
        deliver to the viewing per the funeral home instructions.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>High Schools:</b> High schools do not accept deliveries for students.
        Please send teacher's gifts to the high school and any student orders to
        their residence. Orders to high schools should be placed early because
        they usually must be received by 2pm.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>P.O. Boxes:</b> We are unable to deliver flowers to a P.O. Box or an
        A.P.O. addresses.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>If No One is Home:</b> Depending on the delivery location, if the
        recipient is not available at the time of delivery, the delivery person
        may leave the gift in a safe place for the recipient to retrieve when
        they return, such as with a neighbor, or leave a message for the
        recipient to call to arrange for delivery.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Incorrect Addresses:</b> If the recipient's address is incorrect and
        delivery was attempted to the address, there is a $30 address correction
        fee. Lily-Rose Flowers Bay Area is not responsible for deliveries made
        to incorrect addresses submitted to us by the customer. If such a
        delivery is made, the customer assumes responsibility for the entire
        purchase.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Canceling an Order:</b> Same-day orders are processed immediately,
        and usually cannot be changed. Due to the urgent nature of florist
        delivered products we are unable to cancel or change orders already in
        process at the florist, en route or delivered. To cancel or change an
        order that has not been processed, please call 650-265-8941,
        425-210-5222.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Recipient May be Contacted: </b> In some cases, the florist may
        contact the recipient to ensure s/he will be home to accept the
        delivery.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Request to Leave Item at Door:</b> The customer assumes all liability
        for requests to leave arrangements. We highly discourage special
        instructions requesting delivery to a doorstep, porch, yard or any
        location where the recipient cannot accept the arrangement themselves.
        Lily-Rose flowers Bay Area cannot be held responsible for missing or
        faulty products due to this special request.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Recipient Refusal of Delivery:</b> If the recipient refuses to accept
        a delivery, you may be held fully liable for the cost of the gift.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Card Messages:</b> The message that you write in the Card Message
        field is the message that is sent with the gift. We do not include any
        billing information with your order.
      </p>

      <h2>Substitution Policy</h2>
      <p>
        <b>Fresh Flowers:</b> At Lily-Rose flowers Bay Area we are committed to
        delivering your important emotional sentiments on time and as fresh and
        beautiful as possible. Because of the nature, seasonality, and regional
        availability of flowers it is sometimes necessary to make substitutions
        of equal or greater value. We will make every effort to maintain the
        "look and feel" of the arrangement by considering the overall shape,
        size, style, and color combinations. In single-variety arrangements the
        variety will take precedence over color. For instance, if an order is
        for yellow daisies, they will substitute another color of daisies, not
        another yellow flower. White roses and cream roses may be substituted
        for each other as well as peach roses and pink roses. Purple and pink
        orchids may need to be substituted for white orchids and vice versa.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Balloons:</b> Some hospitals do not allow latex balloons with an
        arrangement. Mylar balloons may need to be substituted for latex
        balloons on some orders.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Gift Baskets:</b> Substitutions within a basket may be made with
        items of greater or equal value if necessary to guarantee freshness and
        timely delivery.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Substitutions for Special Occasions:</b> Due to the importance of
        delivering orders for special occasions, such as funerals, birthdays,
        and anniversaries, on specific days, we may make a substitution of equal
        or greater value to ensure timely delivery, if the flowers you requested
        are not available, and we are not able to contact you via the phone
        number(s) or email address you provided us.
